# statistical analysis 

This is an on-site project for Berea College. 
Using response data from envelope reaction I tried to find if there are statisticially significant difference between the binary set (along the lines of A/B testing)
I am not going into detail here because even though the code is in Python, I used google colab to keep it user friendly and evertyhing is explained in the subtexts. This was only because I had to share the results with a technically inexperienced group of colleagues.
